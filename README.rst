Features
========

Content-types
-------------

- Disabled **Collection**
- **Document**, **News Item** and **Event** are folderish types (thanks to collective.folderishtypes.dx)
- News Item and Event can only contain **Links**, **Images** and **Files**
- **Plone Site** is a DX content
- Revert **News Item** and **Event** to be non-folderish (collective.folderishtypes.dx makes them folderish)

Blocks
------

**volto.blocks** behavior is enabled by default for these content-types:

- Document
- News Item
- Event

There are also some adapters registered for **IBlockSearchableText** to index some common blocks.

Links
-----

There is a custom adapter for TextLine field that return the proper widget for **remoteUrl**.

Custom blocks transformers
--------------------------

There are custom transformers for serializer and deserializer to better manage resolveuids.

There is an edge-case when a block refers its context: in this case, to avoid maximum recursion depth
in uids resolving, that uid will be expanded with the Summary json version and not the full object.


@context-navigation endpoint
----------------------------

plone.restapi's **@navigation** endpoint always return the navigation tree from the site root.

There is a **@context-navigation** endpoint that returns the contextual navigation tree:

    > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder?context-navigation -H 'Accept: application/json'

This is the result::

    {
        '@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder',
        'items': [
            {'@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-a',
                'description': '',
                'title': 'Folder A'},
            {'@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-b',
                'description': '',
                'title': 'Folder B'},
            {'@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-c',
                'description': '',
                'title': 'Folder C'}
        ]
    }

By default only first level is shown.
You can pass an **expand.navigation.depth** parameter to set the depth::

    > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder?context-navigation?expand.navigation.depth=2 -H 'Accept: application/json'

And this is the result::

    {
        '@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder',
        'items': [
            {
                '@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-a',
                'description': '',
                'items': [
                    {
                        '@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-a/folder-aa',
                        'description': '',
                        'title': 'Folder AA',
                    },
                    {
                        '@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-a/folder-ab',
                        'description': '',
                        'title': 'Folder AB',
                    },
                ],
                'title': 'Folder A',
            },
            {
                '@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-b',
                'description': '',
                'title': 'Folder B',
            },
            {
                '@id': 'http://localhost:8080/Plone/folder/folder-c',
                'description': '',
                'title': 'Folder C',
            },
        ],
    }

@site-search endpoint
---------------------

This endpoint works exactly like **@search** but take care of types not searchable settings.


@sitemap-settings
-----------------

Endpoint that returns sitemap settings for anonymous users (that can't access registry entries).

Returns a data structure like this::

    {
        'depth': 3,
    }


@search endpoint
----------------

We customized @search endpoint for that bug: https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi/pull/1066

@querystring-search endpoint customization
------------------------------------------

If we are searching only for `Event` types, do a special search using **get_events** method to search events: that method handle recurrences and avoid wrong results.

Otherwise, perform a default querystring-search.


Disallow bot indexing
---------------------

There is a custom viewlet that add a <meta> tag in the <head> section to prevent bot indexing.

For reference: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/block-indexing?visit_id=637489966041845317-1328107746&rd=1

Patches
=======

Keywords vocabulary
-------------------

We copied the patch from kitconcept.volto_ for special characters in keywords vocabulary
(used for example in Subjects field).

.. _kitconcept.volto: https://github.com/kitconcept/kitconcept.volto/blob/master/src/kitconcept/volto/vocabularies/subject.py


Products.PortalTransforms
-------------------------

See https://github.com/plone/Products.PortalTransforms/pull/43

There is a monkeypatch to apply that changes.

Events recurrence
-----------------

There is a monkeypatch for Events recurrences that fix their duration.

If it works well, we can make a pr in p.a.event.


Respect locally allowed types on paste
--------------------------------------

Disallow paste items that are not allowed into destination folder.


DateTime field serializer/deserializer
--------------------------------------

Customized these adapters to correctly set effective and expires dates.

Without this change, these dates will be stored with UTC hour and not with the current timezone's hour
because behavior's `setter/getter <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.dexterity/blob/master/plone/app/dexterity/behaviors/metadata.py#L278>`_ strip timezone from the value.

With this patch we will send to the setter the date with already localized hour, so even if the setter strip timezone info, we are going to save the correct date.


Fixed dependencies versions
===========================

There are some dependencies fixed in setup.py file.
When Plone 5.2 will be released, we can remove these:

- waitress >= 1.4.3
- plone.app.contenttypes >= 2.1.6
- plone.rest >= 1.6.1
- plone.dexterity >= 2.9.5
- Products.ZCatalog >= 5.1
- plone.namedfile >= 5.4.0
- Products.PloneHotfix20200121 >= 1.0

New Criteria
============

There is one new criteria for Collections and Listing blocks that search on **exclude_from_nav** index.

Events recurrence patch
=======================

There is a monkeypatch for Events recurrences that fix their duration.

If it works well, we can make a pr in p.a.event.


Caching controlpanel
====================

After installation the caching control panel is populated with custom policies while caching is globally enabled by default. Please, set the caching proxies properly.
 

@vocabularies endpoint
======================

Grant **plone.restapi: Access Plone vocabularies** permission to Anonymous users.

This allows users to potentially access to all vocabularies.

To avoid this, we patched the *@vocabularies* endpoint and add an additional checks:

- Anonymous can't access to the vocabularies list (@vocabularies)
- Anonymous can only access to a limited list of vocabularies (see below)
- Simple users (users that only have basic roles like Member and Authenticated) can access to the vocabularies list
- Simple users can only acces to a limited list of vocabularies (see below)
- Advanced users can access to all vocabularies

Available vocabularies
----------------------

- plone.app.vocabularies.Keywords

Customize available vocabularies list
-------------------------------------

There is a check in @vocabularies endpoint that checks if the given vocabulary name  is in a whitelist.

That list is composed joining a list of names provided by some utilities.

There is a base list in this package, but you can extend it registering an utility like this::

    <utility
        provides="redturtle.volto.interfaces.IRestapiPublicVocabularies"
        factory=".my_utility.allowed_vocabularies"
    />


And in *my_utility.py* file::

    def allowed_vocabularies():
        return ["my.vocabulary", "my.other.vocabulary"]


The endpoint get all registered utilities and join all values.

Installation
============

Install redturtle.volto by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        redturtle.volto


and then running ``bin/buildout``
